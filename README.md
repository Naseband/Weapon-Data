# Weapon-Data
Parses a weapon.dat into a usable include. Can contain custom weapons/altered data (ie. for GTAU).

# Usage
After copying the files to your server directory put your weapon.dat into ```scriptfiles/weapon_data/input/```

Load the weapon_data_gen filterscript.

The final include will be located in ```scriptfiles/weapon_data/weapon_data.inc```

In the input folder you can edit weapon_base.pwn if you need to make changes to the main include functions.
